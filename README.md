## About

The Loan Status Prediction project aims to provide a reliable and accurate model for predicting loan approval or rejection. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project helps lenders make informed decisions based on historical loan data and various applicant features.

## Installation

To run this project, the following dependencies need to be installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


## Data

The project utilizes a loan dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consists of various features such as gender, marital status, education, income, loan amount, credit history, and more. The target variable is the loan status, which indicates whether the loan was approved or not.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between variables. It involves tasks such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and handling missing values and outliers.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for model training. It involves tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical variables, and removing outliers. These steps ensure the data is in a suitable format for model training.

## Model Development

Several machine learning algorithms are implemented to build the loan status prediction model. The algorithms used include:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

These algorithms are trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between features and the loan status.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the models are performing in predicting loan status.

## Conclusion

The Loan Status Prediction project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict loan approval or rejection. By analyzing historical loan data and applicant features, the project helps lenders make informed decisions and streamline the loan application process. The project provides a comprehensive solution for loan status prediction and can be extended to handle larger datasets or incorporate additional features.
